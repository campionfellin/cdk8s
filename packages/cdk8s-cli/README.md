# cdk8s-cli

### A command-line-interface for CDK for Kubernetes

<br>

![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/beta-informational.svg?style=for-the-badge)

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

To install the CLI use one of the following methods:

* Homebrew: `brew install cdk8s`
* npm: `npm i -g cdk8s-cli`
* yarn: `yarn global add cdk8s-cli`

> Note: the latest version of the `cdk8s` cli available via Homebrew is `0.33.0` because Homebrew does not accept beta versions. Once a stable `1.0.0` version is released it will be available on Homebrew as well. In the meantime, please use `npm` or `yarn` to install the latest cli.
